```

```

The thumbnail is only displayed on the article list and article page, not on the archive page.

## The icon is displayed on the right side of the title

```yaml front-matter
---
icons: [fas fa-fire red, fas fa-star green]
---
```

The icon is only displayed on the archive page and can be used to mark popular articles.

{% note info, you can set the color of the icon through red / blue / green / yellow / orange / theme / accent %}


## Do you want to show cover

If a page needs a cover, you can write it like this:
```yaml front-matter
---
cover: true

```

```yaml front-matter
---
sidebar: [grid, toc, tags] # Place any sidebar widgets you want to display
---
```
