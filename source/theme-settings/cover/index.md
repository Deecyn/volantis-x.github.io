## Cover height

```yaml blog/_config.volantis.yml
cover:
  height_scheme: full # full, half
  ...
```

Currently the theme provides two home page cover height schemes, and other pages are half screen height.

## Cover layout scheme

```yaml blog/_config.volantis.yml
cover:
  ...
  scheme: dock # search (search), dock (dock), featured (selected), focus (focus)
  ...
```

{% table %}
| Layout plan | Suitable for scene |
| :-- | :-- |
| search | Focus on search |
| dock | More entry options |
| featured | There are about 4 options |
| focus | There are about 4 options |
{% endtable %}


## Default display settings

```yaml blog/_config.volantis.yml
cover:
  ...
  display:
    home: true
    archive: false
    others: false # can be written in front-matter'cover: true'
```

Since the homepage and archive are automatically generated by hexo, you need to set whether to display the cover in the theme configuration file, while other pages can be set in `front-matter` by setting `cover: true/false` to determine whether to display the cover or not Cover.
